    <body><div class='page'><h1 class='title'>COOKIES based injection</h1><br/><br />We&#39;re going to work on Lesson 20.<br /><br />In this lesoon we&#39;re goiong to inject code in the cookie value. This is another way of Error Based Injection.<br /><br />There are many HTTP interceptors and HTTP editors that can intercept the HTTP request before it is sent to the server. Then the tester can introduce his malicious SQL statement in the cookie field.<br /><br />It’s like a get/post based SQL Injection, except that certain characters can’t be used. For example, ‘;‘ and ‘,‘ are typically treated as delimiters, so they end the injection if they aren’t URL-encoded.<p align="center"><img src="images/home.svg" height="22" width="22">  <a href="index.html">Index</a></p></div></body></html>
