This attacker send a <em>request</em> to a Web Server.<br />2) The server receives the <em>request</em> and construct a <em>query</em> that is where the attack is constructed.<br />3) Very ofrten there is a <em>firewall</em> between the Web Server and the Database. But as the query goes through the firewall all the way to the Database, this is one of the thing the attack must be successful.<br /><br /><a href=""><img src="images/4-1.png" alt="images/4-1.png" /></a><br /><br />4) The Database response back to the Web Server through the firewall and eventually back to the attacker.<br /><br /><a href=""><img src="images/4-2.png" alt="images/4-2.png" /></a><br /><br />    This is the way an user comunicates with a Database in a common way. <br /><br />5) When the Web Server talks to the Database must be <em>Authenticated</em>. The database has the user&#39;s credentials to acces to the Web. But if the credentials sent by the attacker are enough crafty, the Database can be compromised and the acces to the system might be a disaster.<br /><br /><a href=""><img src="images/4-3.png" alt="images/4-3.png" /></a><br /><br />6) The database and the technology use on the Web Sever can very really different. You can use ASP, PHP, JAVA, etc.  on the Web Server and MYSQL, ORACLE, etc. or any other Database. That&#39;s why you have to investigate in the first step these aspects. The injection will be different in any case.<p align="center"><img src="images/home.svg" height="22" width="22">  <a href="index.html">Index</a></p></div></body></html>
