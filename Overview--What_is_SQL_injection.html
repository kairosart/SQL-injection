    <body><div class='page'><h1 class='title'>What is SQL injection?</h1><br/><br /><strong>Injection</strong><br /><br />Injection flaws, such as SQL, OS, and LDAO injection occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. The attacker&#39;s hostile data can trick the interpreter into executing unintended commands or accessing data without proper authorization.<br /><br /><br /><strong>SQL Injection</strong><br /><br />An SQL injection attack consists of insertion or “injection” of either a partial or complete SQL query via the data input or transmitted from the client (browser) to the web application. A successful SQL injection attack can read sensitive data from the database, modify database data (insert/update/delete), execute administration operations on the database (such as shutdown the DBMS), recover the content of a given file existing on the DBMS file system or write files into the file system, and, in some cases, issue commands to the operating system. SQL injection attacks are a type of injection attack, in which SQL commands are injected into data-plane input in order to affect the execution of predefined SQL commands.<br /><br /><br /><br /><p align="center"><img src="images/home.svg" height="22" width="22">  <a href="index.html">Index</a></p></div></body></html>
