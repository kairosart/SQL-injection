    <body><div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Seconod Order Injection</h1><br/><br />Second Order Sql injection is an application vulnerability, it occurs when user submitted values are stored  in the database, and then it gets used by some other functionality in the application without escaping or filtering the data. Usually data from external sources (user supplied) is considered dangerous and is escaped/filtered. Developers trust the data coming from the database. This behaviour is similar to Stored Cross Site Scripting attack. Second Order Sql Injection requires more knowledge of how submitted values are later used in order to perform successful second order sql injection.       <br /><br />We&#39;re gping to work on lesoon 24 so as to demostrate the vulnerability. <br /><br />This lesson  is a vulnerable user login, signup and password change functionality. Lets say a user registers, then logins and changes password. Its very common functionality among all dynamic web applications.  Firstly , the users are required to either signup or signin. <p align="center"><img src="images/home.svg" height="22" width="22">  <a href="index.html">Index</a></p></div></body></html>
